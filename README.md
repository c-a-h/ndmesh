backup of NSF REU funded project I worked on as an undergrad
Unfortunately, in undergrad I used SVN :) and not very effectively when it came to this particular project.
So, this is just an import of the last backup I had saved.  It contains the server side scripts,
HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end.  I just want to be able to reference this code easily.

I am the primary author on probably 90% of this code.  Greg Angle is the author of the other 10%.  
He primarily wrote network programs in C to handle passing the commands and data back and forth to the webserver.
Unfortunately, I could not find a copy of that code.

Please see this for a reference of myself and Greg at the ND REU site: http://www.cse.nd.edu/~darts/reupeople.html
